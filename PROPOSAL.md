## GPU Final Project - Pitch
Hannah Bollar, Eric Chiu

## Crowd Simulation using WebGL 2.0 with gpu.js

#### Implementation Features
- [ ] Procedural Marionette Mesh creation / signed distance functions for meshing
- [ ] Inverse Kinematic Animation on GPU
- [ ] Scene Graph Updates on GPU
- [ ] Optimized Crowd Simulations on GPU
- [ ] Stretch
	- [ ] Non flat terrain & having ik and movement work properly for it
	- [ ] Non primitive based procedural marionette
	- [ ] Cycle changes based on Walking, running, lerping based on movement
